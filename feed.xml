Virus species names, however, do not follow a uniform format, and even when binomial, are not Linnaean in style. In this thought exercise, we attempted to convert all currently official names of species included in the virus family &lt;em&gt;Arenaviridae&lt;/em&gt; and the virus order &lt;em&gt;Mononegavirales&lt;/em&gt; to Linnaean binomials, and to identify and address associated challenges and concerns. Surprisingly, this endeavor was not as complicated or time-consuming as even the authors of this article expected when conceiving the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2016 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><link>http://stengleinlab.org/papers/2016/10/22/Kuhn-binomials.html</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://stengleinlab.org/papers/2016/10/22/Kuhn-binomials.html</guid> <category>papers</category> </item> <item><title>New paper on mosquito viruses out</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="/papers/2016/07/31/Fauver-anopheles_viruses.html"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on viruses in wild &lt;em&gt;Anopheles gambiae&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes was recently published in Virology and is one of several articles higlighted in its &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00426822/498"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;. We had the opportunity to write a &lt;a href="http://www.virologyhighlights.com/sequences-characterized-of-new-viruses-that-infect-anopheles-gambiae/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Virology Highlights Blog , (motto: ‘Chosen by editors / Written by researchers’). It was fun to write about the paper in a less formal than usual context and to explain some of the back story and challenges we faced..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several additional reasons that I am happy about the publication of this paper. First, it’s my first ‘last author’ paper, which, I guess, means I’m in charge!?! Second, it is a product of our lab’s growing connections with the other labs in the &lt;a href="http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/academics/mip/aidl/Pages/default.aspx"&gt;AIDL&lt;/a&gt;. I am truly excited about the opportunity to be part of this fantastic group and it was great to work with the Ebel, Foy, and Brackney labs here. Finally, this publication spawned some exciting follow-up projects that we are pursuing. Keep tuned for developments on that front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An anopheline mosquito (image credit: CDC) &lt;img src="/images/anopheles.jpg" alt="anopheles" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2016 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><link>http://stengleinlab.org/blog/2016/10/20/virology-blog.html</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://stengleinlab.org/blog/2016/10/20/virology-blog.html</guid> <category>blog</category> </item> <item><title>Rocky Mountain Virology Club</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend marked the 16th annual meeting of the &lt;a href="http://www.rockymountainvirologyclub.org/"&gt;Rocky Mountain Virology Club&lt;/a&gt;. This meeting draws virologists from Colorado and surrounding states and keynote speakers from further away. There is also usually a good contignent of prion researchers from the &lt;a href="http://csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/academics/mip/prion-research-center/Pages/default.aspx"&gt;Prior Research Center&lt;/a&gt; at CSU. This year’s keynote speaker was Jon Towner from the CDC, who gave a fantastic talk on his research on filovirus reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RMVC is one of my favorite meetings ever. First of all, I am always blown away by the great science. There are lots of opportunities for students and postdocs to give talks and the atmosphere is engaged but friendly. The meeting is also a reasonable size (~60 people or so?). You get a chance to talk with most everyone, including the keynote speakers, which can be tricky at bigger meetings. The meeting schedule is also a lot more relaxed than a typical meeting. A lot of meetings have content scheduled for 12-14 hours a day, which I find to be too much for my brain to absorb. At talk-crammed meetings I usually end up spacing out midday. Here, there is plenty of time for socializing and a break in the middle of Saturday afternoon. This provides a great opportunity to go explore CSU’s &lt;a href="http://www.mountaincampus.colostate.edu/"&gt;mountain campus&lt;/a&gt;, aka Pingree Park, where the meeting is held. Pingree Park is absolutely &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; and about a 1.5 hour drive from Fort collins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pingree Park (image credit: CSU) &lt;img src="/images/Pingree_Park.jpg" alt="Mountain Campus" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aspens are usually in peak color (image credit: RMVC) &lt;img src="/images/pingree.jpg" alt="pingree view" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks bring their families and another unexpected feature of the meeting is really great and free child care (thanks, Joel Rovnak and the organizers!). Each year, Lori, the woman who runs the day care, has the kids do a science-themed art project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an ‘arenavirus’ model that my daughter Dahlia made at the 2014 meeting. (It’s in my office now and is a useful prop when I’m talking to people about viral glycoproteins :)):&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src="/images/arenavirus_model.jpg" alt="an arenavirus" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the kids’ virus models were entered in a competition. The virologists had to guess what kind of viruses these were.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;img src="/images/virus_models.jpg" alt="viruses" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I encourage everyone in my lab to go to this meeting and hope to see you up there too!&lt;/p&gt;</description> <pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2016 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><link>http://stengleinlab.org/blog/2016/09/23/rmvc.html</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">http://stengleinlab.org/blog/2016/09/23/rmvc.html</guid> <category>blog</category> </item> <item><title>Goodbye, Joey!</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is &lt;a href="/team/2015/05/11/joseph-allison.html"&gt;Joey’s&lt;/a&gt; last day in the lab.

Viruses that naturally infect these mosquitoes may impact their physiology and ability to transmit pathogens. We therefore used metagenomics sequencing to search for viruses in adult Anopheles mosquitoes collected from Liberia, Senegal, and Burkina Faso. We identified a number of virus and virus-like sequences from mosquito midgut contents, including 14 coding-complete genome segments and 26 partial sequences. The coding-complete sequences define new viruses in the order Mononegavirales, and the families Flaviviridae, and Totiviridae. The identification of a flavivirus infecting Anopheles mosquitoes broadens our understanding of the evolution and host range of this virus family.
